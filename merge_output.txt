Where exactly in the video (based on subtitles): Starting from timestamp 120.0 to 130.0, this section talks about "Modules and Pip".

What the learner should do:
Play the video starting from timestamp 120.0 to 130.0.

 Converted timestamp to minutes: 
120.0 seconds = 2 minutes
130.0 seconds = 2 minutes and 10 seconds

So play the video from 2 minutes mark to 2 minutes and 10 seconds.
